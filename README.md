# Rhombus vs. Hexagons

A small, Plants vs. Zombies-inspired game implemented in OpenGL using Visual Studio.

At first, the player will notice that there are stars that can appear anywhere on the screen at random intervals, and if clicked on, the user will accumulate a certain amount of stars. Each rhombus is worth a certain amount of stars, and it can be placed anywhere on the 3x3 grid. The player has only 3 lives (hearts).

A rhombus can only shoot down hexagons of the same color. If a hexagon touches the left side of the screen, the player will lose a heart.
